- The print platform is not level.
- The Z-offset between the print platform and the extruder has not been correctly
--adjusted and it's too high.
- The layer prints too fast.
- The temperature or cooling setting is not correct.
- The printing platform:
Plastics adhere differently to each material.
Different surfaces can be used for extrusion materials.
BuildTak for PLA or a treated glass heated surface for ABS.
- Brims and Rafts:
Your piece may be small and not have enough contact surface.
You can try using 'BRIM' generating material perimeters around
the basis of the original design.
Or use 'RAFT' to create a horizontal lattice between the base of the 3D 
printer and the part.
