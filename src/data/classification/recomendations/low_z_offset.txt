- The print platform is not level.
- The Z-offset between the print platform and the extruder has not been correctly 
--adjusted and it's too low.
- The diameter of the extruder may be affecting the Z-offset:
Extruders with larger diameters may require a larger Z-offset
due to the greater extrusion of material, while smaller ones may
require a smaller value.
- Different types of materials influence the Z-offset calibration:
Variable diameters of materials can affect the volume of
extrusion of the molten material.
- Hardware problems:
It may have mechanical problems that affect the accuracy of the Z-offset.
Check for loose, misaligned or aged components that may affect
to the printing precision of the printer.
